# Conflict between React & Vue Next JSX typings

When loading both @types/react and vue-next beta 3, TSX never compiles. For projects who are trying to move from react to vue, it can be a great barrier of entry.

To run into the problem just run the following commands in a prompt

```sh
git checkout
npm ci
npm start
```
